                  Emu8051

Emu8051 is a simulator/emulator for the Intel 8051 family of microcontrollers. It is
available in two versions: a console (text-only) version and a graphical version (using
the GTK+ toolkit). This is an Open-Source project. The program can load Intel HEX files.
Once loaded, a program can be run (it will run indefinitely or until a breakpoint is
encountered). You can also use the STEP button to execute only a single instruction at
a time and see the effects on registers and memory. It is written in C++, and uses Perl
scripts to generate automatically C++ functions corresponding to each assembly instruction
of the 8051 microcontroller.
